**Polynomial Linear Regression** is same as linear Regression but the data points may follow **non-linearity** so in that case we apply Linear Regression and increase the degree such that the line is best fitted in the graph.


Now, When we observe the Dataset, we aren't setting up into training set and testing set because the data points are less mostly.

When we observe the Dataset below 
we have **Age** and **RBC(Red Blood Cells) in billions** are features. Here we are going to predict the RBC's.
Here after observation, the RBC's increases as the age increases upto a point after words it gradually decreases as older people have less production of RBC's. Here it follows non linearity.
